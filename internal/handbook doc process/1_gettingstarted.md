# Overview

Before you begin working on the ILP handbook, get familiar with the following:

* [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
* [reStructuredText (reST) syntax](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html)
* [Read The Docs (RTD) documentation hosting](https://readthedocs.org/)

# Installation

Ensure that you have Git, Python, and Sphinx installed on your desktop.

## Python

Note that Sphinx works with Python 2.7.x and not the 3.x bundle.

[Instructions to install Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)

**Pro Tips:** 

* If you are using a machine with 4GB RAM, install the 32 bit package.
* Any version above 2.7.9 come with `pip` bundled.

## Sphinx

Sphinx is an open source documentation tool that enables auto-creation and preview of documentation authored using reST. It also enables you to generate easy to preview static HTML sites.

[Instructions to install Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/install.html)

The easiest way to install the latest version of Sphinx is using the following `pip` command:

    pip install sphinx

## About reST

reST is a WYSIWYG plain text markup language. While you can use markdown with Sphinx, reST is recommended for technical documentation  due to the better structured and well defined syntax, and greater text formatting options.

For more information, read the [definitive documentation on reST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).

## About RTD

RTD is a community maintained, open source, documentation hosting service. It provides version control and multiple output options, in addition to other useful features.

For more information on usage and implementation, read the [RTD documentation](http://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
