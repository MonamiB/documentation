Next Steps
==========

Once you have the ILP platform up and running, you will need a data entry software setup and linked to the platform.

You can choose any efficient data entry software from the following options that provide support for accurate and complex data inputs:

* Tada - ILP's in-house data entry software. Our team can help you implement Tada within (timeframe) at INR. (ballpark cost estimate/range). (TBD - who to get in touch with? how to?)
* Any open-source data entry application, such as Rainmaker or Typeform (TBD)
* Any subscription-based or paid popular data entry software, such as Lexmark or goCanvas (TBD)
